      <h2>gSchool and Beyond</h2>
      <p>The IT industry here in Colorado is blowing up. It is filled with creative and intelligent individuals that are using technology to create all kinds of things. After gSchool I aspire to join a team of developers that are doing some type of meaningful work. This can include a large number of project goals, but a couple that stand out to me include: <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work geared towards helping small business owners and entreprenurs become successful in their industry. Reducing the probability that younger, more technologicially inclined companies will force them out of business or act as a barrier of entry to begin with.</li>
        <li>Creating something new and exciting that will have an impact on a large number of people in a positive way.</li>
        <li>Working on something that will ultimately simplify someone's life.</li>
      </ul><br>
