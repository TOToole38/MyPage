            <h2>About Me</h2> 
        	<p>Hi, my name is Tricia and I am looking forward to being a part of the first gSchool Fort Collins class! I am a problem solver that likes to learn and to try new things. I relocated from Florida to Denver back in June of 2013 and just recently moved to Fort Collins this past summer. </p> <br>
        
            <p>I graduated from Florida State in 2012 with a degree in Finance and Management Information Systems. It only took one, quick summer for me to realize that life in Financial Services was not for me. After that, I began looking in jobs in IT and never looked back. Before deciding to become a Web Developer, I worked for DISH Network as a systems analyst on their Sling TV product. In this role I worked closely with our development team, and as fate would have it, 4 of them were gSchool graduates. </p><br>

            <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p> Horseback riding has been my outlet and my hobby for most of my life. I ride hunter jumpers and have a 6 year old Dutch Warmblood named Ever. </p> <br>

             <p>After graduating college, I adopted my now 3 year old Rottweiler named Rambo. He is exceptionally spoiled and a terrible excuse for a guard dog. </p><br>

             <p>In my spare time I like to stay active and am on a mission to explore everything Colorado has to offer! My boyfriend Chris and I spend a lot of our time camping, traveling, and hiking.</p><br>
